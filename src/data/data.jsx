      'We have been using SquadDeck for about a year. Other than a few minor issues, overall, it is working well for us. Now all the coaches have adopted it, and they use it regularly. The scheduling part works well. The organization schedulers add the schedules, then the team coaches can independently manage them on their own. Also, the mobile app. As an admin, it gives me full control over all the teams.',
